    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I am Yvonne, but I'd like to be called Raya. I am a second year ECE
      student and a web development cadet here in GDG-PUP.
      <br />I am currently 19 years old and would be turning 20 in few months. I
      have a little background regarding html and css, <br />even java since I’m
      an ICT student way back when I was in Junior High School. <br />I got fond
      of doing these types of things because it keeps me productive and I find
      it fun doing my own design when it comes to webpages. <br />This is one of
      the main reasons I took a technology related course. Many people tried
      asking me on why didn’t I just take IT, CS, or CPE, <br />but I just got
      fond of electronics thus, the reason why I’m an ECE student. <br />I am an
      introvert too, I don’t talk to people unless they start talking to me. I
      think that I don’t know how to keep the communications going but when I
      needed to, I could.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        In terms of my hobbies, I don’t have specific things that I do. <br />
        I’m the type of person that wants to try different things whenever I have time to do so. <br/> 
        Some of the things I do are painting, digital drawing, reading books, watching movies/series/anime, and crocheting. <br/>
        I also play online video games when I’m bored, like Genshin Impact, Valorant, LOL, and some other popular one.
